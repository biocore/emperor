Emperor

[![Build Status](http://ci.qiime.org/job/Emperor/badge/icon)](http://ci.qiime.org/job/Emperor/)

Emperor is a next-generation tool for the analysis and visualization of large microbial ecology datasets; amongst many features Emperor provides a modern user interface that will rapidly adjust to your daily workflow.

To start using Emperor, please refer to the [installation notes](INSTALL.md).

## Usage examples

The main interface to create Emperor visualizations is the `make_emperor.py` script, inputing a mapping file and a PCoA data file, will generate an Emperor graphical user interface to analyze and visualize your data.

If you have a QIIME compliant mapping file and a PCoA file, try the following command from a terminal session:

```bash
make_emperor.py -i unweighted_unifrac_pc.txt -m mapping_file.txt
```

That command will create a new directory called emperor, there you will find a file called `index.html` open it with Google Chrome to start visualizing and interacting with your data.

Similarly if you have a study expressed over a gradient, for example a study where you have multiple samples over time, you can use this metadata with your visualization using the `-a` option:

```bash
make_emperor.py -i unweighted_unifrac_pc_time.txt -m mapping_with_time.txt -a TIMEPOINT
```

Some build examples are bundled with every Emperor repository, you can begin exploring some sample data using **Google Chrome**:
